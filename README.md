# JavaScript-Timed-Quiz
I made this quiz in order to test my knowledge of JavaScript, through creating the questions and answers, but more so in the making of the quiz itself. This application pushed me to the limits of my skill set over and over again. But I found that breaking it down into small steps and utilizing Chat GPT when I got totally stuck.
